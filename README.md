# Assignment: Parsing

This repo has two notebooks in it. One introduces you to parsing with NLTK and includes
our work for class in Week 11. In this work we're going to try to get a custom package that
does SVO parsing working, which will also require us to install the Stanford Parser. 

The second notebook gets you started on the assignment, where I ask you to apply the SVO 
parsing to the convention speeches to reveal the key themes of those speeches.
