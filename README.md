## Assignment: Parsing

This repo has two notebooks in it. The first, `spaCy Tutorial`, is an introduction to 
spaCy by [Damir Cavar](http://damir.cavar.me/). 
The original notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/dcavar/python-tutorial-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/spaCy%20Tutorial.ipynb). This notebook walks you through
many of the features of spaCy, a
tremendously powerful NLP package that 
we'll start using in the latter bit of the course.

The second, `Parsing Introduction`, introduces you to parsing with `spaCy`.  
This notebook introduces you (very briefly) to spaCy. I also recommend watching
the [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnGPv6HnBok) to learn more. 
This notebook will get you started extracting Subject-Verb-Object entities from 
a piece of text. 

### Assignment

In a notebook that you create, extract the SVOs from the Republican and Democratic 
National Conventions. Report the top 25 SVOs from each convention and write a few
sentences about what, if anything, you think we can glean from these lists.
